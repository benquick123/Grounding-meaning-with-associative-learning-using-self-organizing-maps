Using python verssion 3.6.6.

Some examples of already implemented self-organizing maps:
- https://github.com/cgorman/tensorflow-som
- https://codesachin.wordpress.com/2015/11/28/self-organizing-maps-with-googles-tensorflow/ 
(this one is nicely commented so it shouldn't be too hard to change if needed)

As you can see these implementations use tensorflow, which I also prefer when it comes to neural 
networks.
